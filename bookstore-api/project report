Project 3: RESTful Bookstore API â€“ Project Report

1. Title: RESTful Bookstore API

2. Objective:
Develop a RESTful API to manage books and authors in a bookstore. Users can create, read, and delete books, with proper relational mapping between books and authors. This project demonstrates skills in Spring Boot, JPA, H2 Database, and RESTful API development.

3. Technologies Used:

- Java 24
- Spring Boot 3.4.x
- Maven
- H2 Database (in-memory)
- Spring Data JPA
- Springdoc OpenAPI / Swagger UI
- Postman (for API testing)

4. Features / Functionality:

- Add a new book with author
- List all books
- Retrieve a book by ID
- Delete a book
- View database in H2 console
- API documentation via Swagger UI

5. Architecture Diagram:

[Client / Postman / Swagger UI] --> [Spring Boot Controller] --> [Service Layer] --> [JPA Repository] --> [H2 Database]


6. Sample API Endpoints:

Endpoint	Method	Description

- /api/books	GET	Retrieve all books
- /api/books	POST	Add a new book
- /api/books/{id}	GET	Get a book by ID
- /api/books/{id}	DELETE	Delete a book by ID

  "isbn": "123-4567890",
  "author": {
    "name": "John Doe"
  }
}


8. Screenshots / Testing:
