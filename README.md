# Java Internship Projects #

This repository has **two backend projects** developed during my Java intern :

1. **Bookstore API** – RESTful API for managing books using Spring Boot and H2 database.  
2. **Job Portal System** – RESTful API for managing jobs, applicants, and applications using Spring Boot and MySQL.

- Folder: `bookstore-api/`
- CRUD operations for books
- H2 in-memory database

- [Detailed README](./job-portal-system/README.md)

## How to Run Each Project

1. Navigate to project folder :
   
```bash
cd bookstore-api
```
or 

```bash
cd job-portal-system
```

2. Build and run:
   
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

# Access Swagger UI for testing : #

- Bookstore API → http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
- Job Portal API → http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

# Outcomes #

- Building professional REST APIs with Spring Boot
- Database integration (H2 & MySQL) with JPA
- API documentation and testing using Swagger & Postman
- Version control and GitHub project management
